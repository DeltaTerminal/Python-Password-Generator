# Python-Password-Generator
This a password generator that I created using python.
When you run the file :
 It asks you if you want to use it in fixed or variable mode,
 Fixed = (05, 10, 12 or 15 characters) or Variable (0 to 128)
I made the fixed first and started the variable in a different file, when it worked, I integrated it in the first file.
You can find the two different files in the main branch and the file in which they are combined.
Thanks to use my code.
If you find any issues or things that I could upgrades, just tell me I will be opened to suggestions.
